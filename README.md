  - Eric Sorenson - *"The headline here is that the core open-source "Puppet Platform" (puppet-agent, puppet-server, puppetdb) are moving to a more coordinated release model, with compatibility guarantees and consistent versioning among the components. The first release of this "Puppet Platform 5", currently targeted at May, will bring these components' major versions together and provide some nice features without a huge backwards-incompatible break."*
